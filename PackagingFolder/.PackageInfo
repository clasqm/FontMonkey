architecture			x86_gcc2

summary			"A font manager for Haiku with Package Management"
Description			"FontMonkey is a program to preview, load and unload fonts from the clasqm repo.

This program does not manage fonts like the Liberation, SIL or Libertine families that are meant to be drop-in replacements for Courier, Arial or Times New Roman. It also does not touch the standard Haiku fonts. It is specifically for odd, unusual and display fonts that you need to install for a specific project and then remove from your system when they are no longer needed.

An internet connection is required. FontMonkey checks your connection on startup and will ask you to connect before proceeding. It also checks if you have the clasqm repo loaded in your package management system.

This version comes loaded with 107 fonts. More will be added as new font packages are added to the repo and old ones are converted to work with this format.
